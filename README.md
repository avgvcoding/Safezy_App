## Introduction

**Safezy Flask API** is a backend service built with Flask that leverages a machine learning model to predict disasters from user-uploaded images. It is seamlessly integrated with a Flutter mobile application, allowing users to capture or select images from their devices and receive real-time disaster predictions.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images via the Flutter app.
- **Disaster Prediction**: Utilizes a pre-trained FastAI model to predict the type of disaster depicted in the image.
- **CORS Enabled**: Ensures smooth communication between the frontend Flutter app and the backend Flask API.
- **Easy Deployment**: Designed to be deployed on Renderâ€™s free tier with optimized dependencies.

## Folder Structure

```
Safezy_Flask/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ best_model.pkl        # Pre-trained FastAI model for disaster prediction
â”œâ”€â”€ Procfile              # Render deployment configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies

```

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avgvcoding/Safezy_Flask.git
cd Safezy_Flask
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**

```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the optimized `requirements.txt` in the project root. Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify the Model File

Ensure that `best_model.pkl` is present in the project root. This file is essential for disaster prediction.

*Note:* If the model file is large and not included in the repository, consider downloading it from a secure storage or using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS).

## Usage

Run the Flask application locally to test its functionality.

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the app runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### API Testing

You can test the API using tools like **Postman** or **cURL**.

**Using cURL:**

```bash
curl -X POST -F 'file=@path_to_your_image.jpg' http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/predict
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "prediction": "Flood",
  "probability": 0.95
}
```

## API Endpoints

### `POST /api/predict`

**Description:** Predicts the type of disaster depicted in the uploaded image.

**Request:**

- **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`
- **Parameters:**
  - `file`: Image file (formats: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, tiff, webp, heic, heif, jfif)

**Response:**

- **Success (200):**

  ```json
  {
    "prediction": "Flood",
    "probability": 0.95
  }
  ```

- **Error (400 or 500):**

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Error message detailing what went wrong."
  }
  ```

**Example with Postman:**

1. Open Postman and create a new `POST` request.
2. Set the URL to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/predict`.
3. In the "Body" tab, select "form-data".
4. Add a key named `file` with type "File" and upload your image.
5. Send the request and observe the response.
